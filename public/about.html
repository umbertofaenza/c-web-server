            This is a lightweight HTTP web server built from scratch in C as a final project for CS50. It is
            designed to demonstrate the core principles of the HTTP/1.1 protocol, low-level socket programming, and
            data management.
        </p>

            At its heart, the server employs a hybrid routing architecture: it utilizes a Hash
            Table for prioritized static routes while maintaining a dynamic fallback system for assets stored in the
            public/ directory. It also has automated MIME type detection and security filters to prevent directory
            traversal attacks. Hope you like it!
